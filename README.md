# Precomputed Physically Based Atmosphere Scattering for Unity3D
This is an implementation of atmosphere scattering effect in Unity3D.  
The effect is physically based. Heavily used code from [1].  
This repo is currently really early-stage. Only skybox rendering and opaque object aerial perspective is included. More features will be available later.

## Current features
Physically based calculation  
Support multi-scattering  
Runtime parameter update with little performance loss  

## Implementation details.
The scattering events in atmosphere are hard to simulate on real-time, so pre-computation is required, especially when multi-scattering is considered. The idea is basically the same as [1] and [2], and 3D lut is chosen to store precomputed values. the parameter of view-sun angle is omitted.  
The pre-computation aims to generate several textures, and it's possible to do these generations one by one on each frame, making it possible to change atmosphere parameters on run-time, with a little latency before update completes after several frames.  
Compute shader is used to do pre-computation. I find out that compute shader dispatch call time cost isn't really the time cost on GPU, so I can't give an accurate performance test. But my 1050Ti could handle this very well.  

## Known issues
When atmosphere density is high, aerial perspective around horizon is glitchy.  

## TODO
- [x] Aerial perspective on opaque objects
- [ ] Aerial perspective on transparent objects
- [ ] Integerate volume cloud rendering.
- [ ] Optimization on rendertexture usage.
