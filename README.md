# Precomputed Physically Based Atmosphere Scattering for Unity3D
This is an implementation of atmosphere scattering effect in Unity3D.  
The effect is physically based. Heavily used code from [1].  
This repo is currently really early-stage. Only skybox rendering is included. More features will be available later.

## Current features
Physically based calculation  
Support multi-scattering  
Runtime parameter update with little performance loss  

## Implementation details.


## Known issues 
Cloud can only be rendered behind objects. This is not resolved in the original presentation either.  

## TODO
